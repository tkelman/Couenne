                            ========================

This is the Advanced Step Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Toolbox
for IPOPT. It's purpose is to compute fast updates on the optimal
solution of parameterized optimal control problems. For a full
overview of the functionality see the project homepage at
www-users.rwth-aachen.de/Hans.Pirnay 

See the file install.txt in this directory for details on building the
code. The code has only been tested on Linux.
