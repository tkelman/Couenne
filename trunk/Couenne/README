README file for Couenne

Couenne (Convex Over- and Under ENvelopes for Nonlinear Estimation) is
an exact branch-and-bound algorithm that uses a library for bound
reduction, branching, and linearization cuts to solve Mixed-integer,
non-convex Programming problems. It comprises:

1) an expression library;
2) separation of linearization cuts;
3) branching rules;
4) bound tightening methods.

To use Couenne, follow the installation instructions contained in the
INSTALL file in the root directory of this package. Then run

$ couenne instance.nl

specifying a stub (instance.nl) as an input.

Couenne is maintained by Pietro Belotti (belotti@lehigh.edu).

This project was initiated in 2006 by IBM and Carnegie Mellon
University as part of a joint effort to develop algorithms for MINLP.

instances of Convex MINLPs and papers on MINLP) at
